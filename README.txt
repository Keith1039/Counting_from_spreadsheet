How to use the program:
    First save the spreadsheet as a txt file by hitting file, then going to save as, and then clicking  save as type and set it to text(tab delimited).
    Next you are going to save that new text file in a folder with the program.

    Next, this is very important, if you wish to use this program. This program skips the first 5 lines. This is to get rid of all of the information that is not
    needed. If you erase the 5 first lines, the program will still skip 5 more. I'm trying to automate the process as much as possible so please avoid tampering
    with the text file.

    Furthermore, this program is made to count things in the spreadsheet. Essentially, it will only really care about the "make" and "model" of the item.
    If you feel like it, you can manipulate this and have it count other things as well. So long as the format is the same as the CFS_and_EWASTE spreadsheet it 
    should work. Remember however, that it will skip the first 5 lines automatically. I'll have the program ask you which file you want it to do a count on before you
    use it so that you have more options other than CFS_and_EWASTE.txt. If you do decide to do this, Remember to always place the text file in the folder with the 
    program. That is the easiest way for the program to detect it.

    Finally, There are probably a million more efficient methods to do this but it involves some complex things that I'm not even 100% sure of. I'm sidestepping 
    them by using a .txt file instead of reading directly from the spreadsheet data. It's a step down in efficiency but it will Hopefully make this program easier
    to work with on your end.

    To summarize:
    1: save the spreadsheet as a text file
    2: put the text file in the same folder as the program
    3: run the program
    4: input the name of the text file when you're running the program and sit back as it gives you the results(I'll probably have the results in a different file)




Instructions for modifying the keys.txt file:
    The general format for the keys is Model numbers,..,#, Nickname(Basically an easily recognisable name)
    The # is the indicator for the program to know where the model numbers end so make sure to put it.

    I've separated them by the companies that have made them and have left a space between them. This is purely for organization, whether the list of keys is 
    organized or not does not affect the program in the slightest. 

    With all of that said, whenever you want to run this program you will have to save the spreadsheet as a .txt file and the program will most likely ask you to 
    input the name of the text file in question. 

    Even with all of this I can't exactly guarantee that something won't go wrong and the program crashes. The best I can do is to limit the ways it can crash.
    I'm no expert programmer yet so I'm bound to make some oversights. In that case, I'd recommend you either contact me or some programmers in TC if there are
    any. If there are programmers in TC ....Hopefully they won't laugh at my code too much :).

    Good luck guys,
